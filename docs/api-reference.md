LiveData Migrator exposes a REST API for use by external clients. These API resources provide equivalent functionality to the commands described in the [Command Reference](./command-reference.md) except for the commands related to [metadata migrations](#metadata-migrations).

You can access the API documentation for LiveData Migrator directly on your host machine:  
`http(s)://<ldm-hostname>:<ldm-port>/ldm-api.html`
