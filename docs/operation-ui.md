The UI can manage multiple LiveData Migrators as well as LiveData Plane from one convenient interface. It is designed to be intuitive and contains on-screen instructions to help you perform migrations and configuration tasks successfully.

## Before you start

The UI is available on port 8081 on your LiveData Migrator host. For example, if you were running LiveData Migrator on a host named `myldmhost.example.com`, the URL would be:

```text
http://myldmhost.example.com:8081
```

### Register

You'll be asked to register a LiveData Migrator account the first time you use the UI. Fill in the registration form to create your user account.

Internet access from the host is not required, but when it is available, you'll be sent confirmation of your registration. We'll use your registration information to send you important information about your LiveData Migrator account, such as a reminder before your license expires. You can also opt in to receive additional product updates.

### Upgrade your license

If you want to upgrade to a full license before you start using LiveData Migrator, follow these steps:
