By default, LiveData Migrator will use all network bandwidth available to the server unless a specific limit is applied.

To apply a bandwidth limit between the source and target storage(s), follow the steps below:

1. In the **Storages** list on the dashboard, click the settings for the appropriate storage.
1. Select **Bandwidth Management** under the _Grouping_ list.
1. Uncheck the **Unlimited** option.
1. Define the **Maximum bandwidth limit** and **Unit** (for example: MiB/s), and click **Apply**.

You will need to define a bandwidth limit for each LiveData Migrator server (if you have more than one).
